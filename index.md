## About


Hi! I'm **Mohammad Bahrami**, a bachelor's student studying computer engineering. 
For me, constant improvement is the number one priority, whether in me, the people around me, or the surrounding environment. Spending the last year researching several deep-learning projects, I have gained *theoretical knowledge* and *practical experience* in the field.

> I believe in leveraging the power of data to make a difference.
